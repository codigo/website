## Staff Software Engineer

Apr 2022 - Mar 2023

### Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React.js
- Material-UI
- Storybook
- Jest
- React-Query
- React Context API
- GitHub Apps
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Docker

As a Staff Software Engineer at doc.ai (later acquired by Sharecare), I contributed to the development of a distributed health study application, leveraging React, TypeScript, and Material-UI. I implemented robust state management solutions using react-query and React Context API, established comprehensive testing protocols that became team standards, and led the development of a reusable component library that ensured consistency across 5 different projects. I took ownership of frontend performance optimization, code quality initiatives, and mentored junior developers on React best practices and TypeScript patterns.

### Technical Contributions and Leadership

- Led development of multi-project component library using Storybook and TypeScript, establishing reusable UI patterns serving 5 different projects
- Established testing best practices and infrastructure, creating patterns for unit, integration, and component tests adopted by the frontend team
- Spearheaded performance optimization initiatives using react-query caching and request optimization, improving load times by 40%
- Implemented advanced React patterns (custom hooks, HOCs) for code reusability and maintainability
- Mentored team members on TypeScript, React best practices, and test-driven development approaches
- Drove code quality improvements through comprehensive code reviews and establishing frontend development standards

### Key Achievements

- Developed a reusable component library with Storybook, establishing consistent UI patterns and components used across 5 different projects
- Championed test-driven development practices, establishing testing infrastructure and patterns that increased coverage from 80% to 95% and reduced post-release bugs by 70%
- Led performance optimization efforts using react-query caching mechanisms and request deduplication, improving load times by 40% and reducing API call frequency by 50%
- Implemented advanced React and TypeScript patterns including custom hooks for business logic, higher-order components for cross-cutting concerns, and compound component patterns
- Developed efficient data synchronization solutions using react-query and React Context, implementing cache management and error recovery patterns that reduced data fetching errors by 80%

Through this role, I significantly enhanced my expertise in React ecosystem technologies, state management strategies, and test-driven development practices. I also gained valuable experience in healthcare technology, data privacy considerations, and creating user-centric interfaces for diverse populations.
