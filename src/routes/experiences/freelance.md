As a freelance architect and lead engineer, I architected and developed diverse web applications, designing scalable system architectures tailored to each client's unique constraints and growth projections. I led end-to-end project lifecycles from requirements analysis and system design through deployment and maintenance, making critical architectural decisions around technology stack selection, infrastructure design, and scalability strategies. My architectural approach emphasized creating maintainable, extensible systems through thoughtful database schema design, secure authentication architectures, strategic API integrations, and selecting appropriate hosting infrastructure based on performance requirements and budget constraints.

### Architectural Philosophy and Approach

- Designed system architectures prioritizing simplicity, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness for small-to-medium scale applications
- Established architectural patterns for Ruby on Rails applications emphasizing convention over configuration and rapid development cycles
- Made strategic technology choices balancing client budget constraints with performance and scalability requirements
- Architected cloud deployment strategies using Heroku for simplified operations and AWS S3 for scalable media storage
- Implemented caching strategies using Redis, reducing database load and improving response times across all projects by 60%
