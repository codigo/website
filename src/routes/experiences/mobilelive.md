## Lead Architect and Software Engineering Consultant

May 2021 - Oct 2021

### Technologies Used

- Webpack
- Microservices
- AWS
- JavaScript
- CI/CD
- Node.js
- React.js

As a Lead Architect and Software Engineering Consultant at Mobilelive, I led the architectural transformation for a major client by designing and implementing a micro front-end architecture using Webpack Module Federation to solve organizational challenges around team autonomy and deployment independence. I architected 'bolsterJS', a specialized abstraction layer that encapsulated complex Module Federation configuration and routing logic, reducing integration complexity by 75%. Throughout the engagement, I provided expert consultancy on architectural trade-offs between monolithic and micro front-end approaches, established deployment strategies leveraging AWS CloudFront for independent releases, and defined inter-application communication patterns. Additionally, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless adoption of the new architecture across the organization.

- Reduced micro front-end setup time by 75% through the implementation of bolsterJS, significantly improving development efficiency.
- Improved developer experience by separating concerns and clearly defining project scopes, resulting in a 40% reduction in cross-team dependencies and conflicts.
- Decreased time-to-market for new features by 40% due to the modular and flexible coding environment facilitated by bolsterJS.
